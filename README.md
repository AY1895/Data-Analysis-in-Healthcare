# Demographic Data Analysis (with Mortality Correlations)

Python implementation of statistical analysis on demographic data (age, health, marital status, religion) with mortality correlations, originally written in R and converted for Google Colab execution.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Statistical tests (Spearman/Peararson correlation, K-S test, Shapiro-Wilk)
- Hierarchical clustering (Ward method)
- Data transformation and normality checks
- Factor analysis (KMO test, scree plot)

## Dataset
- Expected columns: 
  - Demographic variables (age groups, health status, marital status, religion)
  - Mortality/Death counts (e.g., `TotalDeath`)
- Sample file: `Final.csv` (not included in repo)

## Usage
1. Upload your data to Google Colab
2. Update file paths in the notebook
3. Run cells sequentially

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, scikit-learn, factor-analyzer

## Sample Outputs
- Boxplots & histograms of all variables
- Correlation matrices
- Cluster assignments (saved as CSV)
- Q-Q plots for normality checks
